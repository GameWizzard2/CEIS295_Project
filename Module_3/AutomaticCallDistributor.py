    8.	Ask the user for the number of seconds to run the simulation. Create a for loop that will run one time for each second that was inputted. In the for loop, take these steps:

    a.	Pause the application for two seconds using time.sleep(2)
    b.	Generate a random number from 1 to 3
    c.	If the random number is 1, add a call to the call_waiting queue and then increment the call_number variable. Then, show how many calls are currently in the call_waiting queue.
    d.	Otherwise, if the randomly generated number is 2, remove a call from the call_waiting queue and tell the user that the call is being routed to a service representative. Display the callâ€™s information. Then, show how many calls are currently in the call_waiting queue.
    e.	Otherwise, do nothing to the queue. Tell the user that nothing happened during this second of time. Then, show how many calls are currently in the call_waiting queue.
